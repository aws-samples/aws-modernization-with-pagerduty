   - Create stack, click **Next**
   - Specify stack details, click **Next**
   - Configure stack options, click **Next**
   - Scroll to bottom section under **Capabilities** and check both boxes and click **Create stack**


This template deploys a VPC, with a pair of public and private subnets spread
across two Availability Zones. It deploys an internet gateway, with a default
route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT gateways (one in each AZ), and default routes for them in the private subnets.

This will take a couple of minutes to deploy.
