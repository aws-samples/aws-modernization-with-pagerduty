## Set up your PagerDuty Account

You will need a PagerDuty account to receive alerts from Cloudwatch. If you would like to use a free account, you can sign up for a Developer Account from PagerDuty. It contains certain restrictions but is designed for those who want to work in a safe environment, but is not intended to be a production instance.
